# To Do App
I've written this app for the purpose of learning and as a React / NextJS + Firebase portfolio app. It uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) as its basis to allow easier deployment, better package management and type sharing between frontend and firebase functions. 

## Setup
Clone this repo using

- `git clone https://github.com/rtojagic/todo-app.git`

and run 
- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`

in the root fo the repository. This should bootstrap everything you need.

## Running the app
1. Firebase emulators `TODO`
2. Next app
- `cd` into `apps/todo-next` and run `yarn dev`
